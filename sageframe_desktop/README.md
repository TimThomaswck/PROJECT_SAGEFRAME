# PySide6 Project Template

Easy to use template for PySide6 projects.
This template is designed to help you get started with PySide6 quickly and easily.
It includes a basic project structure, a build script, and a pyproject file.

Even if some company computers are underpowered, they're still usable in most cases.
You just need to install uv and Python 3.8.

  <i>build via pyside-cli</i>
</p>

### Create your project

I recommend using [**pyside-cli**](https://github.com/SHIINASAMA/pys-cli) 
to create your project, for example:

```bash
pip install pyside-cli
pyside-cli create your_project
```

### IDE/Editor Support

- IDEA (PyCharm, CLion, etc.)

- Microsoft Visual Studio Code

### Command

You also can use the command line to run the project.

- Setup development environment.

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

- Using QtDesigner to create UI files. The UI files are must have located in the `ui` folder.

    ```bash
    uv run pyside6-designer app/ui/main_window.ui
    ```

- How to build and package the project. Run the following command to get the help message:

    ```bash
    uv run pyside-cli --help
    ```

- Run test in command line:

    ```bash
    uv run pyside-cli test
    ```

  Or use your environment file to run the app:

    ```bash
    uv run pyside-cli build --stage rc
    uv run --env-file .env -- python -m app
    ```
